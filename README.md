# photo-video-file-renamer
Simple windows app to rename photos and videos based on EXIF date

This is an old project that I made when I was 15, please don't judge :)

## Usage

Simply select the folder that contains the files to rename, and press start. Some settings can be changed, such as the output pattern.
